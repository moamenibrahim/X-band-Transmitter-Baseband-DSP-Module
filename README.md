# X-band-Transmitter-Baseband-DSP-Module
To receive the clock and data from clock and data interfaces, apply the DSP algorithm on the transmitted data. The DSP algorithm includes differential encoding, scrambling and convolutional encoding, generate test data pattern to be used in the self-test mode of operation
